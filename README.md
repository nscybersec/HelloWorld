# Hey World! My name is Nigel! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am on an exciting journey to deepen my knowledge and love for Cybersecurity! I come from an unconventional background and discovered my interest in the field back in 2021 after losing my job due the uncertainty brought by the novel Covid-19 virus.

Since then, I have taken steps to pursue my Cyber Security interests and enrolled myself with [Centre for Cybersecurity (Singapore)](https://www.centreforcybersecurity.com/). The intensive 3 months course has equipped me with the right knowledge and the skills set required of a SOC Analyst such Log Analysis, Wireshark Analysis, ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana) configuration, setting up pfSense Firewall and has solved numerous real world simulations in the ThinkCyber's [Cyberium Arena](https://www.thinkcyber.co.il/).

To further expand my skillset, I've decided to pursue Cyber Securirty education and currently going through a Diploma in Infocomm and Digital Media (Cyber Security) at [Singapore Polytechnic](https://www.sp.edu.sg/pace/courses/course-type/part-time-and-post-diplomas/diploma-in-infocomm-and-digital-media-(cyber-security)) which covers Cyber Security Fundamentals, Ethical Hacking & Defences, Digital Forensics and Cryptography, Secure Coding & System Administration and Incident Management & Malware Analysis.

I am looking to connect with likeminded individuals and will be grateful for any job opportunities in the Cyber Security field.
