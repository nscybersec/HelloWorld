# Hey World! My name is Nigel! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am on an exciting journey to deepen my knowledge and love for Cybersecurity! I come from an unconventional background and discovered my interest in the field back in 2021 after losing my job due the uncertainty brought by the novel Covid-19 virus.

Since then, I have taken steps to pursue my Cyber Security interests and enolled myself with Centre for Cybersecurity (Singapore). The intensive 3 months course has equipped me with the knowledge and the skills set required of a SOC Analyst such Log Analysis, Wireshark Analysis, ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana) configuration, setting up pfSense Firewall and has solved numerous real world simulations in the ThinkCyber's Cyberium Arena.

To further expand my skillset and knowledge in the field, I've decided to pursue a Diploma in Infocomm and Digital Media (Cyber Security) which covers Cyber Security Fundamentals, Ethical Hacking & Defences, Digital Forensics and Cryptography, Secure Coding & System Administration and Incident Management & Malware Analysis.  

I am open to any job opportunities in the Cyber Security field and contactable at nigelstanleydv@gmail.com
